        <h1>Chapter-7: Multimedia</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Multimedia consists of two words ‘Multi’ and ‘Media’, where multi means many and media means way/medium of expressing information. Hence, multimedia is the way of expressing information in different forms. The information can be expressed in either text, audio, video, graphics, and animation. We use several forms of media for better understanding and effective communication. By using multimedia, any information can be illustrated in greater depth.</p>

    <p>Since a single form of media is inefficient for better communication and greater understanding, we integrate several components of multimedia (text, audio, video, animation, and graphics) by using a multimedia computer system. Hence, the integration of different forms of media is mandatory for effective communication. A multimedia computer system consists of multimedia hardware and multimedia software. Printer, projector, webcam, microphone, digital camera, etc., are some of the widely used multimedia computer hardware. Similarly, software like text editor (MS Word), Presentation tool (PowerPoint), Photo editing (Photoshop), Video editing (iMovie), Accounting package (Tally), etc., are used as multimedia software. These multimedia hardware and software work together in order to integrate several components of multimedia. For example, a video can be created by integrating audio and images.</p>

    <h2>Advantages/Merits/Pros/Importance of Multimedia</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>It helps to make communication much more effective.</li>
        <li>It enhances the level of understanding in any particular topic.</li>
        <li>Games, Cartoons, movies are made more effective and realistic by using multimedia.</li>
        <li>It makes the teaching and learning process much more interesting and intuitive.</li>
        <li>Virtual reality and simulation have become more realistic.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Disadvantages/De-merits/Cons/Limitation of Multimedia</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Multimedia components may be expensive.</li>
        <li>Technical knowledge and IT literacy are required to operate multimedia.</li>
        <li>Technology is always changing and never constant.</li>
        <li>Multimedia devices run on electricity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Components/Elements of Multimedia</h2>

    <h3>Text</h3>
    <p>It is the collection of alphanumeric values or any characters. It can be a word, single line, or a paragraph. We can create and customize text by using several text editors or word processors such as MS-Word, Notepad, etc. It is the basic form or way of expressing information. By using multimedia software, we can customize the text by giving it various sizes, colors, types, styles, etc. Extensions of text documents are .docx, .txt, etc.</p>

    <h3>Graphics / Images</h3>
    <p>"A picture is worth a thousand words," which means a picture can describe things more than text. Graphics generally refer to images or pictures. The smallest element of a picture is called a pixel (Picture Element). Hence, the quality of an image or picture is denoted by the number of pixels available in that picture, generally termed as resolution. We use several multimedia software such as Adobe Photoshop, Corel Draw, Adobe InDesign, etc. Extensions of images are .jpeg, .png, etc.</p>

    <h3>Audio</h3>
    <p>Audio is one of the important components of multimedia. It gives the sensation of hearing. Audio can be used to enhance the understanding level in any particular topic. Audio can be human voice, instrument notes, natural sound, digitally synthesized sound, and many more. Nowadays, audio can be transferred from one place to another by converting it into a digital signal. FM radio uses this component to express its information. Several multimedia software such as Windows Media Player can be used to play audio. Extensions of audio are .mp3, .wma, etc.</p>

    <h3>Video</h3>
    <p>Video is the running frames of static pictures, meaning videos are generated by capturing a maximum number of images in unit time. Frame per second [FPS] is the term widely used to describe the smoothness of a video. Generally, there are 15-25 frames per second, to generate smooth movement in a video. But 30 and 60 FPS are the widely used standards in different devices. We can use different multimedia software such as iMovie, Final Cut Pro, Filmora, etc., to edit and customize our video. Extensions of video are .mp4, .mpeg, etc.</p>

    <h3>Animation</h3>
    <p>Animation is the sequence of vector (Computer Generated) images displayed in rapid succession to provide visual effects. These images are computer-based images. Animation is created to express ideas where complex explanations should be effectively delivered. These components are widely used in the movie industry and other entertainment industries. Animation can be either 2D or 3D. 3D animations are more realistic in nature. So, different movies use 3D animation to express information that is not feasible in real life. We use several multimedia software such as Maya Animation, AutoCAD, Macromedia Flash, etc. Extensions of animation are .flv, .gif, etc.</p>
