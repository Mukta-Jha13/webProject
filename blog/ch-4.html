        <h2>MS-Word (Word Processor)</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>MS-Word is a text editing or word processing software developed by Microsoft Corporation, USA under the MS-Office package. Word processing refers to the use of a computer to create, edit, and print documents. A word processor enables us to create a document, store it electronically in a disk, display it on a screen, modify it by entering commands and characters from the keyboard, and print it on a printer. MS-Word is a Windows-based application and has many powerful and advanced features to manipulate the document. With the help of this program, we can create any type of document like letters, reports, thesis, manuals, brochures, advertisements, and many other documents. Besides creating, editing, and modifying the documents, MS-Word provides some special facilities such as checking spelling and grammatical errors, searching for synonyms and antonyms, working with columns, tables, special symbols, pictures, graphs, charts, and more. The document created with MS-Word has the ".doc" extension, and the newer version of MS-Word has the newer extension ".docx".</p>
    
        <h3>Features of MS-Word</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fast operation:</strong> Since MS-Word is a digital text editing software, there is no mechanical movement associated, making it faster in operation.</li>
            <li><strong>Editing text feature (Character formatting):</strong> Any operation like insert, delete, modify the documents, and undo/redo, find/replace can be performed very easily. Text can be customized in any form or style like bold, italic, underline, different font size, color, and style.</li>
            <li><strong>Permanent storage:</strong> Using MS-Word, files and documents can be electronically stored in a disk or any other storage media, allowing retrieval whenever required.</li>
            <li><strong>Graphics:</strong> MS-Word allows us to insert various objects like pictures and graphs anywhere in the document when needed.</li>
            <li><strong>OLE (Object Linking and Embedding):</strong> OLE is a technology used to share information between programs through objects, like charts, equations, pictures, audio, and video files.</li>
            <li><strong>Mail merge:</strong> Mail merge is a useful tool that allows us to easily produce multiple letters, labels, envelopes, and more using information stored in a list, database, or spreadsheet.</li>
            <li><strong>Searching:</strong> MS-Word allows us to search any word or text and replace or delete it with other necessary words throughout the entire document.</li>
            <li><strong>Printing:</strong> MS-Word allows users to print the documents created anytime, anywhere.</li>
            <li><strong>Formatting a document:</strong> Word has various tools that help format a document. Formatting refers to the process of enhancing the appearance of the document to make it more readable and attractive. We can search and replace, display rulers, change paragraph alignment, change line spacing, create bullets, and numbering to show information in a list. We can also add borders, shading, and watermarks to enhance the appearance.</li>
            <li><strong>Spelling and Grammar checker:</strong> MS-Word provides several features that help produce a professional and error-free document by checking grammatical and spelling errors and notifying users with colored wavy lines (red for spelling errors, green for grammatical errors).</li>
            <li><strong>Use of thesaurus:</strong> MS-Word’s thesaurus makes it possible to look up synonyms and antonyms to words with a few clicks of the mouse, allowing automatic replacement of a word with its respective antonyms or synonyms.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>MS-Excel (Spreadsheet)</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>MS-Excel is a spreadsheet software in the Microsoft Office suite that allows users to store, organize, and analyze numerical and text data. It is a part of the MS-Office package. A spreadsheet program allows presenting information in a clear way and performing mathematical calculations using various formulas and equations. Excel also allows converting spreadsheet data into various charts like bar graphs, columns, and more. It can be used to calculate data for various purposes such as salary sheets, income and expenses statements, balance sheets, budget preparation, grade, and percentage calculation, etc. Some application areas of Excel include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Basic mathematical calculation</li>
            <li>Financial modeling and analysis</li>
            <li>Statistical analysis</li>
            <li>Scientific and engineering calculation</li>
            <li>Graphic presentation and more</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>The extension of MS-Excel files is “.xlsx” and “.xls”.</p>
    
        <h3>Common Terminologies Used in Spreadsheet</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Worksheet (Spreadsheet):</strong> A worksheet is a collection of rows and columns used to list, organize, and calculate data.</li>
            <li><strong>Workbook:</strong> The files used in spreadsheets are collectively known as workbooks. A workbook is made up of several worksheets. By default, one workbook contains three worksheets.</li>
            <li><strong>Cell:</strong> The intersection of rows and columns is called a cell. A cell reference is given by entering the column letter followed by the row number, e.g., C2. The cell where the intersection point occurs is called the active cell.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Features of MS-Excel</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>It facilitates working in multiple worksheets simultaneously.</li>
            <li>It allows us to create different types of charts and graphs.</li>
            <li>It allows us to organize and manage large volumes of data.</li>
            <li>It allows us to perform any type of calculation automatically using custom formulas and equations.</li>
            <li>It allows easy sorting of data in ascending and descending order.</li>

        </ul>
    
        <h3>Cell Reference in Excel (V. important)</h3>
        <p>A cell location in a spreadsheet is referred to as its cell reference. To find a cell reference, simply look at the column heading to find which column the cell is in and across to find which row it is in. The cell reference is a combination of the column letter and row number such as A1, B3, Z9, etc. When writing cell references, the column letter should always come first. Specially, cell reference is very important when writing formulas or addressing the cell to evaluate it. For example, if we want to add values 3 and 2, which are in A1 and A2 respectively, instead of writing A3=3+2, we write A3=A1+A2.</p>
    
        <h3>Types of Cell References</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Relative cell reference:</strong> A relative cell reference identifies the location of a cell or group of cells. By default, a spreadsheet cell reference is relative. This means formulas and functions can be copied and pasted into other cells. Examples: A1, B4, G9.</li>
            <li><strong>Absolute cell reference:</strong> An absolute cell reference identifies the location of a cell with the column letter and row number surrounded by dollar signs ($), e.g., $A$2, $G$9, $Z$345. It is used when you want the cell reference to stay fixed on a specific cell. An easy way to add a dollar sign is to click on the cell reference and then press the "F4" key on the keyboard.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>MS-PowerPoint (Presentation)</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
