        <h1>Chapter-3: Software and OS</h1>
        <h2>Software - Introduction:</h2>
        <p>As we know, stand-alone hardware cannot do anything. For the smooth operation of our computer system, there should be proper coordination between hardware and software. Software helps to mobilize the hardware and other resources. In order to mobilize hardware, we have to write several sets of instructions which instruct the computer on what to do and what not to do. These sets of instructions are collectively known as a program, and the term software is the collection of related programs and associated documents. In order to produce useful output, hardware and software must work together. Nothing useful can be done with the hardware only, and software cannot be utilized without hardware. The different types of software are:</p>
        
        <h3>1) System software:</h3>
        <p>System software is a set of one or more programs designed to control the operation of our computer system. This type of software doesn't fulfill the specific requirements of the user. They are general programs written to assist humans in the use of the computer system. In general, system software supports the running of other software, communicates with peripheral devices, supports the development of other types of software, and monitors the use of various hardware resources. Thus, the system software makes the operation of the computer system more effective and efficient. The system software is categorized into two categories.</p>
    
        <h4>1.1) System Management:</h4>
        <p>It is responsible for the proper management and functioning of the computer system. All types of management between computer hardware and software are performed by system management software. There are 3 types of system management software:</p>
    
        <h5>1.1.1) Operating System:</h5>
        <p>The operating system is a collection of programs that control the overall operation of the computer system. It is the 1st program that is loaded into memory when the computer is turned on. It provides a platform for other application programs to run and execute. It provides the user with an interface so that users can easily communicate with the computer. For example: Linux, Windows, Mac, etc.</p>
    
        <h5>1.1.2) Utility Software:</h5>
        <p>Utility software is the supporting software which is used to perform specific tasks related to the maintenance of the computer system. Some of the utility software are included in the operating system, whereas some are available as separate utilities in the market. They are also called service programs. For example: Norton Utility, PC tools, WinZip, etc.</p>
    
        <h5>1.1.3) Device Driver:</h5>
        <p>A device driver is software that is responsible for the smooth functioning of the hardware device that is connected to the computer. When we add a new device to the computer, we need to install new software called the device driver. The device driver will coordinate with the operating system, and the newly installed hardware functions properly and smoothly.</p>
    
        <h4>1.2) System Development:</h4>
        <p>It refers to a set of programs that are used to develop computer programs. These types of software are not used by a normal user of the computer. They are used by programmers for the development of new programs. There are two types of system development software:</p>
    
        <h5>1.2.1) Programming Language:</h5>
        <p>The language with which we give instructions to the computer is known as a programming language. Programming languages are the set of different keywords, variables, operators, loops, and other symbols, etc. They help to make communication between the computer and user. These are two types of programming language: low-level language and high-level language.</p>
    
        <h5>1.2.2) Language Translator:</h5>
        <p>A language translator is a special kind of computer software that translates programs written in one language into another language. It is compulsory for both low-level and high-level languages. It is also called a language processor. The types of language translators are: compiler, interpreter, and assembler.</p>
    
        <h3>2) Application Software:</h3>
        <p>Application software is a set of one or more programs which are designed to do a specific task. It is made to fulfill the user's demand. This program directs a computer to solve user-oriented problems such as preparing bills, calculating mathematical equations, preparing mark sheets, etc. The software that is developed for user purposes is called application software. These types of software are generally developed by using high-level language. For example: MS-Excel, Photoshop, Billing software, etc. There are two types of application software:</p>
    
        <h4>2.1) Packaged Software:</h4>
        <p>They are the generalized set of programs designed and developed for general purposes. It is generally large-sized, error-free, advanced, and standard software with much more functionality for special work. This type of software doesn't perfectly match the requirements of many organizations or users. They cannot be changed easily, are developed and designed by reputed software companies, and are trustworthy. They are expensive for small organizations. For example: MS-Office, Adobe, Macromedia, etc.</p>
    
        <h4>2.2) Customized/Tailored Software:</h4>
        <p>This is software developed in high-level language for special tasks. This type of software is developed for some specific purpose for solving a specific problem of a specific user or organization. The requirements of the user or organization can be perfectly matched. They can be changed easily since they are made by local programmers. For example: payroll system, inventory management, school management, billing software, mark sheet evaluation, etc.</p>
    
        <h2>Operating System - Introduction</h2>
        <p>An operating system (OS) is an integrated set of programs that controls overall resources such as CPU, memory, input-output devices of the computer system. The major objective of the operating system is to improve the performance and efficiency of a computer system. Like the manager of a company, an operating system is responsible for the smooth and efficient functioning of the entire computer system. The operating system provides the platform for other application programs/software to run and execute. It provides users with an interface so that users can easily communicate with computers, which is more convenient to use and operate.</p>
        <p>An operating system is a collection of programs that controls the overall operation of the computer system. It also controls and coordinates the use of hardware among the various application programs for various users. So, it acts as an interface between users and computer hardware. The other major functions of the operating system are:</p>
    
        <ul>
            <li>It controls, monitors, and coordinates the overall operation of the computer system.</li>
            <li>It acts as an interface between the user and the computer.</li>
            <li>It provides a platform to develop, run, and execute other computer programs.</li>
            <li>It manages hardware resources such as CPU, memory, input-output terminals, networking equipment, etc.</li>
            <li>It hides programming and hardware complexity from the user.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The primary goal of an operating system is to maximize the productivity of a computer system by operating it in the most efficient manner and maintaining the amount of human intervention. Some examples of operating systems are: MS-DOS, Windows, LINUX, MACOS, UNIX, Chrome, Fedora, Ubuntu, etc.</p>
    
        <h2>Functions / Features / Advantages of Operating System (OS)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1) Input-Output (I/O) Management:</strong> Input-Output is essential to operate any computer. It allows the computer to interact with several peripheral devices such as keyboard, mouse, printer, scanner, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>2) User Interface (UI):</strong> User Interface means an ideal environment in which a user can work on it so that they can interact with the computerized system. Every operating system provides the feature of user interface to enhance the experience and joy of using a computer or any other computerized system. It acts as a bridge between the user and the computer. There are 2 types of user interfaces:
                <ul>
                    <li>Character/Command User Interface (CUI): Eg MS-DOS</li>
                    <li>Graphical User Interface (GUI): Eg Windows, MAC OS</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>3) Security:</strong> The operating system of a computer has a number of built-in tools to protect against security threats such as viruses, unauthorized access, suspicious network activity, etc. The basic security in an OS is to control access to your computer by setting users and passwords.</li>
            <li><strong>4) Process Management:</strong> The process management allocates a processor to execute a chosen process. OS acts as a traffic controller, job scheduler, process scheduler, and dispatcher.</li>
            <li><strong>5) Memory Management:</strong> Memory is a large array of bytes, each with its own address. When the user requests the CPU for read-write operation, OS determines the amount of memory required for the program instruction and data, then OS allocates required memory to load the program and data into RAM. When the program terminates, it frees up the space, and a new program is loaded.</li>
            <li><strong>6) Data Management:</strong> Data management allows organizing data into logical groupings called files. Earlier, operating systems did not provide features of data management. Hence, they were inflexible, but nowadays, every operating system provides this feature.</li>
            <li><strong>7) Command Interpreter:</strong> The command interpreter reads the command that a user types in at a terminal, interprets them, and translates them into a detailed set of instructions that the computer hardware can understand. Every operating system must have a command interpreter for its operation.</li>
            <li><strong>8) Deadlock Prevention:</strong> During processing, a situation can arise in which resources shared by two or more processes cannot continue because the resources required by a process are held by others. This situation is called a deadlock. The operating system ensures prevention of deadlocks by taking specific actions through careful allocation of resources.</li>
            <li><strong>9) Time Sharing:</strong> The function of OS that involves allocating time to several users on the same computer. This property is generally found in network operating systems such as Windows NT.</li>
            <li><strong>10) Virtual Memory:</strong> Virtual memory is the feature of an operating system that allows a computer to compensate for a shortage of physical memory by transferring temporary files from RAM to disk. Virtual memory has twice as many addresses as main memory. The process of translating virtual addresses into real addresses is known as mapping. The copying of virtual pages from disk to main memory is called swapping.</li>
        </ul>

          <h2>On the Basis of Processing</h2>
          <h3>1) Multi-programming OS:</h3>
          <p>Multi-programming is used in multi-user environment. It is the technique in which multiple user programs are executed simultaneously by a single processor. Multi-programming means when two or more than two programs are provided to the CPU for processing or loaded in the internal storage of CPU at the same instant of time. From the loaded program, once the portion of one program is executed and the portion of another program is executed and so on. Thus, multi-programming refers to concurrent execution of several programs. The main purpose of multi-programming is to increase the utilization of computer and its resources. Different forms of multi-programming OS are multi-tasking, multi-processing, and multi-user.</p>
  
          <h3>2) Multi-tasking OS:</h3>
          <p>Multi-tasking OS allows more than one program to run concurrently mainly in a single-user system. These computers are capable of executing several tasks or programs at the same time. For executing several tasks, it can be a single or multi-processing system. In some multi-tasking systems, one of the processes is called foreground (active) and others are called background (inactive). Multi-tasking OS increases the productivity of the user by executing many tasks simultaneously. Some of the most common examples are MS-Windows, Linux, MAC OS, etc.</p>
  
          <h3>3) Multiprocessing OS:</h3>
          <p>Multi-processing system has more than one processor linked in a coordinated way. Multiprocessing OS supports running a program on more than one CPU. Generally, super servers are especially designed to support multiple processors. UNIX is commonly used multi-processing OS. Multi-programming and multiprocessing are not the same concept. Multi-programming involves concurrent execution of two or more programs by a single CPU, whereas multi-processing involves two or more processors (CPU) controlling the execution of many programs simultaneously. Multiprocessing is also known as parallel processing. It is a more costly and complex technique than multi-programming, dramatically increasing the program execution speed of computers.</p>
  
          <h3>4) Time-Sharing OS:</h3>
          <p>Time sharing is a technique which enables many people located at various terminals to use a particular computer system at the same time. Processor time, which is shared among multiple users simultaneously, is termed as time-sharing. Multiple jobs are executed by the CPU by switching between them, but the switches occur so frequently that users receive an immediate response.</p>
          <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
          <ul>
              <li>Provide quick response.</li>
              <li>Reduce CPU idle time.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
          <ul>
              <li>Problem of reliability.</li>
              <li>Less security.</li>
              <li>Integrity issues.</li>
          </ul>
  
          <h3>5) Batch Processing OS:</h3>
          <p>Batch processing is a technique that requires grouping similar jobs, which consist of programs, data, and system commands. It is also known as offline processing. This type of processing is suitable for programs with large completion or involvement, such as payroll, weather forecasting, statistical analysis, etc. Users do not need to wait while the job is being processed. They can submit their program to the operator and collect them later, which means the jobs are entered, stored on a disk in a batch or queue, and executed one after another under the control of the OS.</p>
          <p><strong>Major disadvantage:</strong> Batch processing does not allow interaction between the user and the program during execution.</p>
  
          <h3>6) Multi-threading OS:</h3>
          <p>A program in execution is known as a process and can be divided into multiple smaller subprocesses. These subprocesses are known as threads. A multi-threading OS has the ability to divide a process into threads and execute them concurrently. Threads are individual processes that execute simultaneously in a multi-tasking OS.</p>
  
          <h3>7) Real-Time OS:</h3>
          <p>Real-time processing method controls the environment by receiving data and taking action quickly to affect the functioning of the environment at the same instant of time. It is an online processing system in which processing time is critical. The entire processing task has to be completed within the predefined time. The real-time OS is suitable for operations such as:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Airlines or flight seat availability</li>
              <li>Rocket Launching system</li>
              <li>Wholesale supplier and manufacturer, etc.</li>
          </ul>
  
          <h3>8) Online Processing OS:</h3>
          <p>Online processing is a popular processing technique in the present day. In this method, transactions are processed as soon as they happen at the place of origin. It is quite simple compared to real-time OS. In this type, users can interact or provide input during processing, and the output is provided back to the user as soon as the processing is completed.</p>

          <h2>On the Basis of User Interface (UI)</h2>
          <p>A user interface allows the user to interact with the computer system. It provides the user with an ideal environment to experience better computing. It brings structure to the interaction between the user and the computer. Without a user interface, it would be almost impossible to operate a computer smoothly. To enhance the experience of using the computer, UI plays a vital role. There are two main types of User Interface (UI):</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Character User Interface (CUI)</li>
              <li>Graphical User Interface (GUI)</li>
          </ul>
  
          <h3>1) Character User Interface (CUI):</h3>
          <p>CUI is a type of operating system in which the whole computer operates or depends upon the commands issued by the user. All the operations that take place in CUI have their own specific command. Hence, they are known as Character User Interface. The user has to remember all the commands needed to operate the computers. It is a non-user-friendly interface. Only people with technical knowledge can operate this type of operating system. It is a primitive type of OS where graphics, pictures, icons, drop-down menus, and dialogue boxes are not used, making it more difficult to use. It uses the character or text mode of computers such as DOS and UNIX. A command prompt is a sequence of characters used in CUI. Commands are typed in to instruct the computer. MS-DOS is an example of a Character User Interface operating system.</p>
  
          <p><strong>Features of CUI:</strong></p>
          <ul>
              <li>Single-user and single-tasking operating system.</li>
              <li>Less user-friendly than GUI.</li>
              <li>Commands are used to instruct the computer.</li>
              <li>User needs to remember the command for operating the system.</li>
              <li>Cannot display graphics, icons, pictures, or multimedia.</li>
              <li>Faster than GUI systems.</li>
              <li>Pointing devices such as a mouse, joystick, or track-pad are not recognized.</li>
              <li>Can be used in low memory and low-processing computers.</li>
          </ul>
  
          <h3>2) Graphical User Interface (GUI):</h3>
          <p>GUI is a type of operating system where the computer is operated just by clicking or selecting the required icon or dialogue box instead of writing a direct command to the system. Graphics like icons, pictures, drop-down menus, dialogue boxes, etc., are used, which makes it more user-friendly than CUI. Since users do not have to remember any commands, everyone without technical knowledge can use this type of OS. GUI is widely used for domestic applications. The goal of the graphical operating system is to create a system that the computer user can turn on and operate in the right way without any training or remembering commands. The main advantages of GUI are its ease of use, especially for beginners. The main disadvantage is that it consumes more memory for operation. Examples of GUI operating systems are Windows, MAC OS, etc.</p>
  
          <p><strong>Features of GUI:</strong></p>
          <ul>
              <li>User-friendly and easy to use.</li>
              <li>Users do not need to remember commands.</li>
              <li>Supports full multimedia and animation.</li>
              <li>Requires larger memory for its processing.</li>
              <li>Can be used in network environments.</li>
              <li>It is multi-tasking, multi-programming, and multi-user operating systems.</li>
              <li>Supports a variety of peripheral devices.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>On the Mode of User</h2>
          <h3>1) Single User:</h3>
          <p>A single-user OS is a type of OS developed for use on a computer that will only have a single user at any given time. This is the most common type of OS used on home computers and office systems. There are two general types of single-user systems: Single-user single-tasking and Single-user multi-tasking. An example of a single-user single-tasking system is MS-DOS, PC-DOS, etc.</p>
  
          <h3>2) Multi-user:</h3>
          <p>A multi-user OS is a computer operating system that allows multiple users on different terminals to access a single system with one OS. The multi-user OS shares computer resources among different users, allowing each user a small slice of the processor time. This concept is known as time-sharing. Each user gets the impression that they are all being served simultaneously, even though the OS serves them one at a time. Examples include Linux, UNIX, etc.</p>

          <h2>Some Important Operating Systems in Use</h2>
          <h3>Open Source Operating System:</h3>
          <p>Open source refers to applications whose source code is freely available on the internet for worldwide users. Users can customize the source code according to their requirements without buying the license. Open-source software is free of cost. Examples include Linux, UNIX, Mozilla, Apache, etc.</p>
  
          <h3>UNIX:</h3>
          <p>UNIX is a powerful, flexible, and manageable operating system with good utilities and communication abilities. It is a multi-user, multi-tasking, and multi-processing operating system used on larger machines like mainframes and minicomputers. UNIX was developed by AT&T Bell Labs around 1970 AD.</p>
  
          <h3>Linux:</h3>
          <p>Linux is an open-source, powerful UNIX-based operating system. It can run on various platforms, including Intel, PowerPC, DEC Alpha processors, and multiprocessing systems. Linux was developed by Linus Torvalds at the University of Helsinki as a college project. Examples of Linux distributions include Red Hat, Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, etc.</p>
  
          <h3>MAC OS:</h3>
          <p>MAC OS is a popular GUI-based OS for Apple Inc. It is used in Apple Macintosh computers and has high-quality graphical user interfaces. Earlier versions of MAC OS were compatible only with Motorola 68000 series processors, but now they are also compatible with Intel processors.</p>
