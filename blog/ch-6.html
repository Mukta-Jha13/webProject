        <p>WWW is a series of services that are interconnected through hypertext. It provides links in the web document. It was created in 1990 at the European Particle Physics Laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland, to exchange and share data through the Internet using the protocol known as Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).</p>
    
        <h4>Web Browser</h4>
        <p>A web browser is a computer program that accesses web pages and displays them on the computer screen. It is the basic software needed to find, retrieve (open), view, send, and receive information over the Internet.</p>

        <h3>Introduction to HTML</h3>
        <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is used to create web pages for exchanging data and information over the Internet.</p>
    
        <h4>Advantages of HTML</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>It is easy to use, flexible, and user-friendly.</li>
            <li>It is supported by all major web browsers and operating systems.</li>
            <li>It is compatible with all search engines.</li>
            <li>HTML 5.0 introduces several advanced features.</li>
            <li>HTML files take less time to load.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h4>Disadvantages of HTML</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>It is difficult to create interactive and attractive web pages using only HTML.</li>
            <li>It cannot be used to create dynamic webpages.</li>
            <li>It is only a scripting language and not a programming language.</li>
            <li>There are many incompatibilities in HTML.</li>
            <li>There is no fully accepted standard for HTML.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h4>HTML Tags</h4>
        <p>HTML tags are instructions given to the web browser to organize text, images, and other components on web pages. Tags are written inside angular brackets < >.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pair tags:</strong> Tags with both opening and closing parts (e.g., &lt;html&gt; and &lt;/html&gt;).</li>
            <li><strong>Singular tags:</strong> Tags with only opening tags (e.g., &lt;br&gt;).</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h4>HTML Attributes</h4>
        <p>Attributes are descriptive properties of HTML tags that provide additional features, allowing customization of components on a webpage.</p>
        <p>For example: 
            <code>&lt;body bgcolor="lightblue"&gt;</code> where <code>bgcolor</code> is the attribute that sets the background color of the page.
        </p>
        <h2>Write All the HTML Tags, Attributes, and Related Information in a Notepad</h2>
        <p>Write the tags, attributes, and related information in a simple text editor such as Notepad.</p>
    
        <h2>Save Your Document</h2>
        <p>Save your document with the desired name followed by the <code>.html</code> extension. For example: <code>sample.html</code></p>
    
        <h2>Execute the HTML File Using Any Web Browser</h2>
        <p>Once saved, you can open the HTML file using any web browser to view the content and structure.</p>
    
        <h2>Some Common Terminologies of Web Designing</h2>
    
        <h3>Webpage</h3>
        <p>A webpage is generally an HTML document or written in any other scripting language that helps to execute information in the form of text, images, or other components through the Internet.</p>
    
        <h3>Website</h3>
        <p>A website is the collection of interrelated webpages. A website may contain any piece of information or have information interrelated with several webpages connected through hyperlinks. All websites have two parts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Domain Name:</strong> The name used to access a website.</li>
            <li><strong>Web Server:</strong> A storage location where all the information related to the website is stored.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Home Page</h3>
        <p>The home page is the introductory page that appears first when accessing a website.</p>
    
        <h3>Web Browser</h3>
        <p>A web browser is an application program that helps to access any content of webpages using HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol). This protocol helps make communication between the web browser and the web server. Examples of web browsers include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Google Chrome</li>
            <li>Internet Explorer (Microsoft Edge)</li>
            <li>Safari</li>
            <li>Mozilla Firefox</li>
            <li>Netscape Navigator</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>URL (Uniform Resource Locator)</h3>
        <p>URL is a standard way of referencing a protocol, host, and directory. For example: <code>https://readersnepal.com</code></p>
    
        <h2>DBMS (Database Management System)</h2>
    
        <h3>Data</h3>
        <p>Data are raw facts and figures. Data are isolated, uninterpreted, and do not provide any meaningful information unless processed. For example: Ram, 19, 12, Pokhara.</p>
    
        <h3>Information</h3>
        <p>Information is the meaningful result obtained after processing data. It gives sense and meaning to raw data. For example: Ram is a student, aged 19, who lives in Pokhara-12.</p>
    
        <h3>Database</h3>
        <p>A database is a systematic and scientific arrangement of data so that it can be retrieved easily when needed. It is an organized collection of data that is used to convert data into information. Examples of databases include a dictionary, mark ledger, census, and telephone directory.</p>
    
        <h3>Database Management System (DBMS)</h3>
        <p>Since manual collection and organization of data is time-consuming, unsecured, and complex, a database management system (DBMS) is used to help maintain and organize databases. A DBMS is a collection of software that helps manage data stored in a database, allowing easy retrieval and processing. Examples of DBMS software include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>MS-Access</li>
            <li>MySQL</li>
            <li>Oracle</li>
            <li>FoxPro</li>
            <li>dBase</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Advantages/Features/Importance of DBMS</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>It allows users to search quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>It helps to reduce data redundancy (repetition).</li>
            <li>It allows users to share data over a network.</li>
            <li>It helps in data security and privacy.</li>
            <li>It improves data consistency (reducing variance).</li>
            <li>It provides an organized way of storing data.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Disadvantages of DBMS</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Installation and operating costs are higher.</li>
            <li>It requires more disk space.</li>
            <li>There may be security and privacy issues.</li>
            <li>Technical manpower (Database Administrator) is required to maintain and operate the system.</li>
        </ul>
