        <h2>1's and 2's Complement</h2>

<h3>1's Complement:</h3>
<p>The 1's complement of a binary number is obtained by changing all 1's to 0's and all 0's to 1's. For example, the 1's complement of (1011)<sub>2</sub> is (0100)<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<h3>2's Complement:</h3>
<p>The 2's complement is obtained by adding 1 to the 1's complement of the given binary number.</p>
<p>For example, if (1010)<sub>2</sub> is the given number, then:</p>
<ul>
    <li>1's complement is (0101)<sub>2</sub></li>
    <li>2's complement is (0101)<sub>2</sub> + (1)<sub>2</sub> = (0110)<sub>2</sub></li>
</ul>

    <li>Adding (00110)<sub>2</sub> with (11101)<sub>2</sub>, we get (00110)<sub>2</sub> + (11101)<sub>2</sub> = (100011)<sub>2</sub>.</li>
    <li>Since there is an extra bit (5 digits + 5 digits = 6 digits), remove that extra bit and add it on the remaining bit: (00011)<sub>2</sub> + (1)<sub>2</sub> = (00100)<sub>2</sub>.</li>

<h2>Introduction: Boolean Logic</h2>

<p>Boolean Algebra is algebra of logic, which deals with the study of binary variables and logical operation. As every data are represented in terms of binary values, we need to manipulate those values by using some certain rules and expression which we can do through Boolean algebra. It is most common and basic method to analysis and design logic circuit. It was introduced by an English mathematician George Boole. In Boolean algebra the variables can have only one of the two possible value 0 and 1 (False or True). Every modern digital computers understand either this two values.</p>

<h3>Boolean algebra:</h3>
<p>It is algebra of logic which could accept either of the possible two values 0 and 1 and generate a result through logical relationship and operation.</p>

<h3>Boolean variable:</h3>
<p>Those entities which has either or 0 and 1 and denote some specific operation ore known as boolean variable. Simply, it is an entity in Boolean algebra which has only either of the two possible values. This variable are denoted by A, B, P, Q, X, Y, Z….</p>

<h3>Boolean function (logic functions):</h3>
<p>Boolean function is an expression formed by binary variables, binary operators such as AND, OR, NOT, parentheses, and equal sign for a given set of value this boolean function gives the 0 or 1 as a result.</p>

<p>let us consider,</p>

<p>F = XYZ’+XY</p>

<p>Where, F is a boolean function</p>
<p>X, Y, Z are a boolean variable.</p>
<p>X, Y, Z, Z’ are also literals.</p>

<h3>Truth Table:</h3>
<p>A table which represents the input-output relationship between of the binary variables for each logical gate called truth table. It shows the relationship between input and output in tabular form. Thus, truth table is table representing the results the logical operation of the logical operation on all possible combination of logical values.</p>

<h2>Boolean Operator and Operands</h2>

<p>Operators are the symbols that define the specific operation. These are three basic operators used in Boolean Algebra, ie. AND, OR, NOT. Every other operations can be expressed in terms of this basic operation. For examples, NOR operator is the combination of NOT and OR operators. The three basic operators are:</p>

<h3>a. AND Operators:</h3>
<p>AND operator is represented by “.” So, A AND B is represented by (A.B). The result of the AND operation is exactly same as simple arithmetic multiplication. That means result will be high (1) only when both the inputs are high. Note: A AND B can also represented by AˆB or AnB. Truth table of AND operation is given below</p>

<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <th>A</th>
        <th>B</th>

    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h3>b. OR Operator:</h3>
<p>OR operator is represented by “+” So, A OR B is represented by (A+B). The result of the OR operation is exactly same as simple arithmetic addition. That means result will be low (0) if and only both the inputs are low. Note: A OR B can also represented by AvB or AuB. Truth table of OR operation is given below</p>

<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <th>A</th>

        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h3>c. NOT Operator:</h3>
<p>NOT operator is represented by “-” or “ ’ ”  So, NOT operation of an operands A is represented as A’. NOT operation performs negation. That means it will give high output (1) for low input (0) and vice-versa. Truth table of NOT operation is given below</p>

<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <th>A</th>
        <th>A'</th>
